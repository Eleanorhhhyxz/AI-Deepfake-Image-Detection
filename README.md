# AI-vs-Human-Generated-Imgae-Detection
This repo stores codes for the 2025 Women in AI Kaggle Challenge (https://www.womeninai.co/kagglechallenge2025). The orginal dataset contains images generated by AI or human from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/detect-ai-vs-human-generated-images).

The repo stores code containing three different approaches for solving the AI vs Human generated image classification problem: Dual-Branch Network, Xception & Regnet, and Vision Transformer LLM. It also contains code for developing an online app with streamlit, which allows users to upload an image and select a model to determine if the image is generated by AI or human.
